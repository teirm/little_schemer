pg 53:
======
Can you see how multimember works?
    Multimember takes an atom and a lat
    Checks to see if lat is null first
    if not null, checks to see if atom a == car lat
        if it does, call multimember a on cdr lat (dropping car lat)
    else we cons car lat onto multimember a cdr lat. 

The statement:
  ((null? lat) (quote ()))
works because we will be consing
a bunch of elements into the empty
list once we hit this base case.
